# Containers for genomics workflow introduction

Containers are isolated packaged environment (contains OS, application etc.)

There are a couple places to get pre-made docker container images. Popular ones are Docker Hub and Quay.
These host images across all segments, so you'll need to search by the name of the specific tool(s) you need images for.
Biocontainers and Dockstore are sites that provide more focused searches for bioinformatics and genomics related tools.
They will still provide links / instructions for pulling the images from either Docker Hub or Quay.
