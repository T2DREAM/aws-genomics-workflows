# Data Storage

You will need a robust location to store your input (contact DGA to deposit raw files to DGA bucket) and output data (created in your AWS region Europe, US east/west, Asia etc. to minimize data latency).

The following are key criteria for storing data for genomics workflows

* accessible to compute
* secure
* durable
* capable of handling large files

Amazon S3 buckets meet all of the above conditions.
