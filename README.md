# Genomics Workflows on AWS

This repository is the source code for [Genomics Workflows on AWS](www.docs.t2depigenome.org/genomics-workflows).  It contains markdown documents that are used to build the site as well as source code (CloudFormation templates, scripts, etc) that can be used to deploy AWS infrastructure for running genomics workflows.

## Building the documentation

The documentation is built using mkdocs.

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ conda env create --file enviroment.yaml
```

This will create a `conda` environment called `mkdocs`

Build the docs:

```bash
$ source activate mkdocs
$ mkdocs build
```
